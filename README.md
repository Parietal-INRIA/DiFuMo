# DiFuMo atlases

1. We provide Dictionaries of Functional Modes “DiFuMo” that can serve as atlases to extract
   functional signals, eg to serve as IDPs, with different dimensionalities
   (64, 128, 256, 512, and 1024). These modes are optimized to represent well raw BOLD timeseries,
   over a with range of experimental conditions.
   
       - All atlases are available in .nii.gz format and sampled to MNI space
   
2. Additionally, we provide meaningful names for these modes, based on their anatomical
   location, to facilitate reporting of results.

       - Anatomical names are available for each resolution in .csv

## Datasets and Statistical model used to extract these atlases

For this, we leverage the wealth of openly-available functional images
(Poldrack et al., 2013) and stochastic online matrix factorization algorithm
(SOMF, Mensch et al., 2018), sparse dictionary learning.
